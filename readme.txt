A plugin that provides the ability to configure WordPress site settings that are not provided by default in the admin screen using a GUI.

== Description ==
There are various settings to make when operating a WordPress site. This can be easily done because WordPress provides tools to allow for GUI configuration in the admin screen, but there are also quite a few setting tools that are not provided. This plugin collects setting items that WordPress does not provide and provides functions that allow easy configuration via GUI.
1. Redirect Settings
Makes the site accessible at the root URL of the domain, even if the site is installed in a subdirectory of the domain.
2. Post menu change settings
Provides the ability to change settings for the built-in post type, post, through a GUI.
3. Revision Control Settings
This setting will display a menu on the post management screen to set the number of revisions held for each post. It will also show the default number.
4. OGP Settings
Output OGP tags on each page of the site. We have confirmed that OGP tags are output on X, Facebook, and LINE.
5. Google SEO Settings
Google Search Console, Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics (GA4) tags will be output on each page of the site.
6. Security Settings
We will set three security settings:
- Change the default login URL (wp-login.php).
- Block access to ?author= and the REST API /wp/v2/users.
- Disable the XML-RPC endpoint.
